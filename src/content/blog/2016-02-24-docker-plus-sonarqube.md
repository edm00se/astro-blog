### Intro

I'm on Notes in 9 again. This time, I'm back with an introduction to general use of [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/), a great tool for code quality checking and coverage reporting which [Christian GÃ¼demann](https://guedebyte.wordpress.com/) talked about in his IBM Connect session. Christian's got a passion lately for automation and continuous deployment, so you may wish to watch his blog for further developments, especially with the great advances going on with [OpenNTF](https://openntf.org/). The best part is that SonarQube pairs well with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), which you may have heard of if you haven't been living in a cave for the last year or more.

### The Video

### Summary

I may have been a crazy person after not blogging much for a little while, so stay tuned for more on the blog and another Notes in 9 is on its way; my promised highlights of my IBM Connect session. There are lots of great things going on in the development and XPages spaces, so everyone hold on tight, it could get a little bumpy.
