### Vote for IBM ConnectED 2015 Sessions

Also known as [**Please Vote For Me!**](https://www.socialbizug.org/blogs/We87208a0e2cc_4798_ac0e_537d0ced54e2/entry/from_soup_to_sandwich_making_mvc_java_classes_and_front_end_development_work_for_you?lang=en_us)

### I Want It All

It'll all be there. Me, some awesome development stuff, geeky references, and a round house <s>kick</s> demonstration of using:

- Java controller classes
- RESTful servlets
- AngularJS
- Bootstrap 3

### My Original Abstract

Before the reduction, due to character limit, my abstract read as:

#### From Soup to Sandwich: Making MVC Java classes and front-end development work for you

##### Summary:

Covering the (best) practices of MVC Java patterns, with Domino, while utilizing a front-end / AngularJS application with Bootstrap 3 to create an interface that performs great across browsers and devices, enforces application logic on the server, and makes your interface compete with the big dogs.

- that last part may be slightly conceited, but I'll be using AngularJS to show-off browser implementation and it's a Google library
- this is meant to be a basic level walk through of MVC, client/front-end development against a RESTful servlet, and adaptive interfaces for a modern and relevant application development strategy
- any component can be easily used, making for individual developer-opinionated use

##### MVC patterns

- an intro to enforce the concepts while focusing on RESTful interaction via a Java servlet in Domino (not a deep dive into MVC)
- which enforces application logic through controller classes
- vs CRUD-only operations of Domino Data services
- why to "trust" or not your user base (DDS allowing all input, which can break a view, etc. vs servlet approach)

##### AngularJS framework as an interface to a Domino/XPages application

- application will be simple, extend a modified copy of David Leedy's Fake Names NSF, for simplicity's sake
- implements a custom Bootstrap 3 theme
- show how to use with XPages (intro level)
- highlight the framework's abilities and strengths (dynamically updating charting)

##### Conclusion

- brings together several concepts into one harmonious application
- application uses the best of each part to the advantage of the whole, demonstrating flexibility of Domino/XPages latform
- amount of developer control is high, making for easy adoption
- segregation of multi-developer implementation is quite possible; e.g.- can use
  _ front-end AngularJS, or whichever framework-specialized, developer
  _ Marketing to control Bootstrap3 theming via CSS
  _ Domino / Java developer to control Controller classes and application logic
  _ or you can go insane and do it all
