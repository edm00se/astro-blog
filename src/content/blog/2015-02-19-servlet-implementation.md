### Intro

The [first post](/xpages-servlets/servlet-intro-and-flavors) covered the first two parts of [this series](/servlet-series/), the basics of what a servlet is and three "flavors" of servlet classes. This post begins with how to implement a servlet so that they're actually accessable via an end point.

### ServletFactory

[A factory is](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(object-oriented_programming)>), [in OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), an object for creating other objects. In order for these servlets to be "registered" with the application to be end point accessible, they need to be provided by a ServletFactory; specifically, one that implements `com.ibm.designer.runtime.domino.adapter.IServletFactory`. This will register an end point via a pair of `Map`s which match, via a key, the package.class name to the end point name. This makes the servlet accessible via `<your NSF>/xsp/<end-point-name>`.

#### A Note on IServletFactory

In one of the more counterintuitive things I've run into since starting Domino/XPages development, the `IServletFactory` package is fully there on the server and usable, but the `lwpd.domino.adapter.jar` needs to be added as an external JAR to the build path in Designer. [Sven Hasselbach](https://hasselba.ch/blog/?page_id=70) has done an excellent job of showing how to do this in [his blog post on the subject](https://hasselba.ch/blog/?p=746). Sven's blog is a great read with some very applicable posts on REST security, including CORS topics and more; I highly recommend reading his blog, if you don't already.

### Marrying the ServletFactory to the Application

#### Marriage, The Short, Short Version

Your `ServletFactory` needs one last step to be registered as usable by your application. Here's the short, short version.

After adding your "external JAR" to your build path, you need to create a file called `com.ibm.xsp.adapter.servletFactory`. Create that file in `<NSF>/Code/Java/META-INF/services/`; it's easiest if you switch to Package Explorer first. In this file, place the fully qualified package.Class name of your `ServletFactory`. Once your application builds, you're good to go with your keyed servlet names from your `ServletFactory`.

#### The Less-Short Version

The file we'll created needs to be in the project bulid path. In Domino 9 (and late 8.5.3 versions, anything in which there came a `Code/Java` and `Code/JARs` design section in the Application perspective), we should focus on the Code/Java section. For older versions, the classic location tends to be `WebContent/src`; the bottom line is: **it must be a part of your build path**. To create the file, it's best to switch views to Package Explorer.

You'll need to right-click on your `Code/Java` folder and select New, followed by Other. Select folder and create one called `META-INF/services/`` (it'll nest the second one).

Then do the same, selecting file, and call it `com.ibm.xsp.adapter.servletFactory`. In this file, we put a single line for the class which will do the assigning of end points to servlet Classes.

```
com.eric.test.ServletFactory
```

### Registering Your Servlet Classes

Now that we finally have our `adapter.servletFactory` file pointing at our ServletFactory Class, we can start adding them into the ServletFactory. Here's one I prepared earlier.

Aside from a bit of voodoo, this should show how we can map our end point names to the class names and proper names, respectively. As you can see, I mapped each of my example servlets (`HttpServlet`, `DesignerFacesServlet`, and `AbstractXSPServlet`) from the last post into respective endpoint names/keys. The table below shows the resulting mapping of the endpoint (after the server/path/NSF/).

| Servlet Endpoint            | Servlet Class                                  | Name                         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| /xsp/exhttpservlet          | com.hello.servlets.ExampleHttpServlet          | Example HttpServlet          |
| /xsp/exdesignerfacesservlet | com.hello.servlets.ExampleDesignerFacesServlet | Example DesignerFacesServlet |
| /xsp/exabstractservlet      | com.hello.servlets.ExampleAbstractedServlet    | Example AbstractXSPServlet   |

### Summary

Now we have a servlet and it's fully registered with the application and accessible via an HTTP endpoint. The next post will get into what we do with these servlets.
