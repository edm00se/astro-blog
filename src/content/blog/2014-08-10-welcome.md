### Welcome to the Development Blog of [edm00se](https://edm00se.github.io).

This is the landing place for my person trials, tribulations, and triumphs in regards to:

- to my day job
- IBM/Lotus Domino/XPages
- AngularJS
- NodeJS and Express
- Source Control
- and more

### A Promise

I can promise only to post something worthwhile to other developers of beginner to intermediate skill levels, that are (hopefully) interesting, and don't make me sound like a rambling idiot. Time will tell on that last one.

For starters, you can find my ramblings across the Intarwebs via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/edm00se), [GitHub](https://edm00se.github.io/), [and more](https://about.me/EricMcCormick).
